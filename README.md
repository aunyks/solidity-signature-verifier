# Signature Verifiers

Some example Solidity contracts demonstrating on-chain verification of off-chain signatures. One contract is for pure-Solidity verification, and the other uses OpenZeppelin's [`ECDSA`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/cryptography#ECDSA) library.  

Doing signature verification on-chain is tricky. These contracts and their associated unit tests document how they can safely be done.
